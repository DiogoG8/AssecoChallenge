# Asseco Challenge

The challenge was done in two parts. The first part consisted in doing a web application in JavaScript, following mockups given by the challenge statement. In the second part I added extra functionality, styling and tools.

## First Part

The first part refers to the Asseco challenge. The challenge was made with React, JavaScript and HTML. For styling CSS and TailwindCSS were used.

To initiliaze this part you should:

1. Go to the 'frontend' folder;
2. Do 'npm i';
3. Do 'npm run start'.

## Second Part

The goal of the second part of the challenge, was to show more tools and skills beyond the first part. These are the topics touched:

1. Agile Methodologies (SCRUM);
2. More Frontend and Design Thinking;
3. Backend and Database Usage.

### 1. Agile Methodology:

Since the challenge had the time limit of a week, I thought it would be useful to make a weekly planning of what I wanted to achieve. Using SCRUM, a planning board with a sprint was built. Inside of the sprint, three different user stories were created with tasks inside. In the 'attachments' folder there should be screenshots of this planning (done with GitHub Project Workflow)

### 2. More Frontend and Design Thinking:

One of the things added in the second part, was a confirmation message when a transfer is completed. In the 'attachments' folder there is a picture of a Figma wireframe built with the idea behind it.

In addition, a media query for small phone sizes (sizes S and M) was built using TailwindCSS, to show a different and responsive design in comparison to the initial mockup.

### 3. Backend and Database Usage:

The major change between the first and second part, was the addition of a backend enviornment. The backend was made with Node.js and Express.js following a REST API architecture. The point of building a backend for the challenge was to POST the transfers done in the frontend in a database (done with MySQL). All the information regarding the database can be found in the 'assecoform.sql' file on the 'backend' folder.

### Initializing the Full Project:

To start the project you should:

1. Go to the 'AssecoChallenge' folder;
2. Do 'npm i';
3. Run the 'assecoform.sql' file on the 'backend' folder;
4. Create an 'env' file and establish a connection with the new database;
5. Do 'npm run dev' on the 'AssecoChallenge' folder.
